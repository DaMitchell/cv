One was for their in-house processes to manage all the asserts their products required and then moving them to the required platforms. The other was a front of class teaching aid that would allow the teacher to display these assets and plan lessons. Both projects were being run in an agile fashion, where we would have daily scrums sprint meeting every 2 weeks with the client to plan for the following sprint where we used either JIRA or Pivotal to track the work. I was also pulled onto a couple of Kentico products which required me to use .Net as well as my front-end skills."}
